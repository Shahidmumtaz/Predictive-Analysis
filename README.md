# Predictive-Analysis

ïƒ˜	I occasionally check home prices and it is interesting that despite the pandemic house prices have not declined.  There are several factors that impact house value, such as location, vicinity of shopping centers, age, area income level, environment, politics etc. I want to find out if housing prices will continue to appreciate despite the pandemic economic crisis and will it be a smart decision to invest in a house in the near future. Perhaps an analysis here will help me get a clear picture from the USA housing dataset from Kaggle.
